### Pygame AI Simulation Framework
This project creates a simple simulation with two agents that can move around the screen using the keyboard. Here's a breakdown of the main features:

Window Setup: The window is 600x400 pixels, and the background color is black.
Agents: There are two agents, one blue and one red. They can be moved independently using different keys:
Blue Agent: Uses arrow keys (left, right, up, down).
Red Agent: Uses WASD keys (A, D, W, S).
Movement: Both agents can move left, right, up, and down within the window, but they cannot go out of bounds.
Resetting Positions: Every 60 seconds, both agentsâ€™ positions are reset to their starting points.
Frame Rate: The game runs at 60 frames per second (FPS).
Display: The frame count (in seconds) is displayed on the top left for debugging purposes.
The code uses the Pygame library to create the simulation and manage movement and display.
